{"name":"Thumbor-enterprise-edition","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThumbor Enterprise Edition (a.k.a thumborEE) is a library to generate encrypted\r\n[thumbor](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/wiki \"thumbor docs\") URLs.\r\n\r\nIn order to use it, just download the latest version from the listed versions\r\nbelow in the Downloads section of the readme file and add it to your project.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nUsing thumborEE is pretty simple, all you have to do is create a CryptoURL\r\ninstance with the proper key and original image URL and start customizing it.\r\n\r\n```java:\r\nCryptoURL crypto = new CryptoURL(\r\n    'my-security-key',\r\n    'http://my.server.com/path/to/my/image.jpg'\r\n);\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(\r\n    crypto.resize(300, 200).withSmartCropping().toString()\r\n);\r\n\r\n// /l42l54VqaV_J-EcB5quNMP6CnsN9BX7htrh-QbPuDv0C7adUXX7LTo6DHm_woJtZ/my.server.com/some/path/to/image.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Available Options\r\n\r\nFor more information on what each option means don't forget to check [thumbor's\r\ndocumentation](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/wiki \"thumbor docs\").\r\n\r\n## metaDataOnly\r\n\r\nTells thumbor to return metadata instead of the actual image.\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.metaDataOnly()```\r\n\r\n## withSmartCropping\r\n\r\nTells thumbor to use smart cropping (Face and Feature Recognition).\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.withSmartCropping()```\r\n\r\n## resize\r\n\r\nChanges the target width and height for the generated image.\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.resize(width, height)```\r\n\r\nPS: if one of the dimensions (width or height) is zero, proportional dimension\r\nis applied. If both are zero, original image is returned.\r\n\r\n## fitIn\r\n\r\nTells thumbor that the specified image must fit in the given box (defined by\r\nwidth x height).\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.fitIn(width, height)```\r\n\r\n## align\r\n\r\nTells thumbor to crop based on a given alignment (Left, Center, Right, Top,\r\nMiddle, Bottom). For more info, check [thumbor's\r\ndocumentation](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/wiki \"thumbor docs\").\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.align(CryptoURL.HAlign.LEFT, CryptoURL.VAlign.TOP);```\r\nOr: ```crypto.align(CryptoURL.HAlign.LEFT);```\r\nOr: ```crypto.align(CryptoURL.VAlign.TOP);```\r\n\r\nPS: If you supply only one alignment, the default is assumed for the other one.\r\n\r\n## crop\r\n\r\nSpecifies the bounding points that tell thumbor where to manually crop the\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.crop(left, top, right, bottom);```\r\n\r\n## withFilter\r\n\r\nTells thumbor to use this filter. Can be called multiple times to specify different filters.\r\n\r\nUsage: ```crypto.withFilter(\"quality(20)\").withFilter(\"round_corner(3,255,255,255)\")```\r\n\r\n# Downloads\r\n\r\n* [Release 0.3.0 (04-Apr-2012)](https://github.com/heynemann/thumbor-enterprise-edition/blob/master/downloads/thumboree-0.3.0.jar \"thumbor-enterprise-edition 0.3.0\") - Bug fix (Contribution of Fernando Carolo).\r\n* [Release 0.2.0 (15-Mar-2012)](https://github.com/heynemann/thumbor-enterprise-edition/blob/master/downloads/thumboree-0.2.0.jar \"thumbor-enterprise-edition 0.2.0\") - Filters support.\r\n* [Release 0.1.0 (14-Mar-2012)](https://github.com/heynemann/thumbor-enterprise-edition/blob/master/downloads/thumboree-0.1.0.jar \"thumbor-enterprise-edition 0.1.0\") - Initial release, still lacking filters support.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThumbor is licensed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\n> The MIT License\r\n\r\n> Copyright (c) 2011 Bernardo Heynemann <heynemann@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
